## Overview
This react web app creates a memory game. 

This application renders different images to the screen. 

Each image listens for click events.

The application then  keeps track of the user's score. 

The user's score is increse when the user clicks on an image for the first time. 

The user's score is reset to 0 if the user clicks the same image more than once.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
